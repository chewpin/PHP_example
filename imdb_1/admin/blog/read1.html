              <h4> BY DOMINICK SUZANNE-MAYER,BLAKE GOBLE AND JUSTIN GERBERON  </h4>
              <p>  JANUARY 27, 2015, 2:00PM  </p>
              <p>
                Twenty years ago this week, Richard Linklater first introduced us to Jesse and Celine in Before Sunrise, kickstarting a trilogy of films &ndash; also including Before Sunset and Before Midnight &ndash; that offered one of cinema&rsquo;s most authentic portrayals of love: the good, the bad, and the ugly.
              </p>
              <p>   
                Dominick Mayer (DM): For a movie as navel-gazing and utterly &rsquo;90s in certain respects as Before Sunrise is, it&rsquo;s the fount from which one of Linklater&rsquo;s foremost accomplishments sprung. And it&rsquo;s a perfect follow-up to his previous film to boot. Where Dazed and Confused perfectly captures the listlessness of high school summers, all intoxication and wandering conversation and just wandering in general, Before Sunrise continues that thought but adds to it the pangs of onset adulthood. Before Sunrise perhaps works best when viewed through that lens, because even as someone who adores it, I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that itâ€™s the easiest of the three films to side-eye just a little.
              </p>
              <p>   
                After all, it&rsquo;s really, really enamored with what college kids have to say about life. But, as the Before films go on to insist with increasing fervor, the conversations don&rsquo;t necessarily matter as much as the way they&rsquo;re delivered and the subtle cues between Ethan Hawke&rsquo;s Jesse and Julie Delpy&rsquo;s Celine. For them, wandering the streets and canals of Vienna is just something to do while in transit to elsewhere, and they&rsquo;re killing time with an attractive stranger as best they can in the interim. They&rsquo;re clearly compatible but in that way that you are specifically in the earlier days of college, when meeting people and wandering through social modes is an integral part of your day-to-day life, when you&rsquo;re enamored with just getting to know somebody that isn&rsquo;t like anybody you&rsquo;ve met before. In those scenarios, whether the other person even makes for particularly great company is beside the point.
              </p>
              <p>   
                Now, I know you two may well end up preferring the grounded realism of later installments to the dreamy, European whimsy of the first, but Sunrise is a great, great film concerned with watching people fall in love, from the first meet cute onward. It&rsquo;s measured and observed in a way films like this in its own time, and even now, really aren&rsquo;t.
              </p>
